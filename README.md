# JuliaHEP base container image

Container build specification for `registry.cern.ch/juliahep/juliahep-core`.

This container image is part of the [JuliaHEP](https://www.juliahep.org/)
effort. It forms the basis for `registry.cern.ch/juliahep/juliahep-core`.
The image contains a fairly minimal Linux distribution and current Julia
versions, but has not Julia packages preinstalled.
