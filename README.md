# JuliaHEP core container image

Container build specification for
[`registry.cern.ch/juliahep/juliahep-core`](https://registry.cern.ch/harbor/projects/3833/repositories/juliahep-core/).

This container image is part of the [JuliaHEP](https://www.juliahep.org/)
effort. It forms the basis for
[`registry.cern.ch/juliahep/juliahep-base`](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/juliahep_juliahep-base_img).
The image contains a fairly minimal Linux distribution and current Julia
versions, but has not Julia packages preinstalled.
